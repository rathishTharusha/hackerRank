You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A subarray of nums is called continuous if:

For every pair of indices i1 and i2 within the subarray, the absolute difference between nums[i1] and nums[i2] is at most 2:

0 ≤ | nums [i1] - nums [i2] | ≤ 2

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Your task is to determine the total number of continuous subarrays in nums.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n — the number of elements in the array nums.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array nums.
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁷
1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹
Output Format

Print a single integer: the total number of continuous subarrays.
