A frog is at the bottom of a staircase with N steps. The frog can jump either 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Your task is to compute the number of distinct ways the frog can reach the N-th step.

Write a function to calculate the number of ways the frog can reach step N using only jumps of 2 or 3 steps.

If N ≤ 1, the frog cannot reach the goal, so print 0.

Input Format

A single integer N representing the number of steps.

Constraints

N≤50

Output Format

A single integer representing the number of unique ways.

5
Sample Output 0

2

For N = 5, the frog can reach the 5th step using the following valid jumps:

Jump sequence: 2 → 3 The frog first jumps 2 steps, reaching step 2, and then jumps 3 steps to reach the 5th step.

Jump sequence: 3 → 2 The frog first jumps 3 steps, reaching step 3, and then jumps 2 steps to reach the 5th step.

Therefore, there are 2 distinct ways for the frog to reach the 5th step.

Sample Input 1

1
Sample Output 1

0
Explanation 1

The frog can only jump 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Since 1 is less than the minimum jump length of 2, the frog cannot reach step 1. Therefore, there are no valid ways for the frog to reach the first step, and the function should return 0.
