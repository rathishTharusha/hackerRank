You are given a list of N integers stock_prices, where stock_prices[i] represents the stock price on the i-th day.

For each day, determine how many days you have to wait until a higher stock price appears in the future. If no such day exists, return 0 for that day.

Return the result as a space-separated string of integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁷) — the number of days.

The second line contains N space-separated integers prices[i] (1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10⁵) — the stock prices on each day.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁷

1 ≤ stock_prices[i] ≤ 10⁵

Output Format

Print a single line containing N space-separated integers, where the i-th integer represents the number of days you have to wait after the i-th day to get a higher stock price. If no future day has a higher price, print 0 for that day.
